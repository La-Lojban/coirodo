      Every once in a while, I decide to play around with the constructed
      language
      <a href="https://lojban.org/">Lojban</a>. Mostly I am interested in
      language learning (and teaching), and like
      Lojban because it's a small, self-consistent language. It also potentially
      has many applications with regards to machine translation and AI.

   <p>
      Lojban advocates claim it is possible to learn lojban far more quickly
      than natural languages, because the grammar and spelling are much more
      regular, and because of the heavy use of affixes. My interest is in
      flattening the learning curve even more by applying cutting edge language
      training techniques.

         <a href="./ctuca/01.html">conversational lojban, lesson 1</a> is a web
         based lesson similar in feel to the popular Pimsleur tapesets. You will
         learn how to make some simple statements and ask simple questions, as
         well as introduce yourself.

         LearnFast <a href="https://mw.lojban.org/index.php?title=learnfast.zip&redirect=no">(1.3MB download)</a> is a
         flashcard-style program written with
         <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080525071425/http://www.pygame.org/">pygame</a>
         that steals ideas from Pimsleur and also from
         <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080525071425/http://www.superlearning.com/">Superlearning.</a>. It
         currently teaches 64 lojban gismu (content words similar to verbs,
         nouns, adverbs, and adjectives in English). The theory behind it is
         described in <a href="sutra/LEARNFAST.TXT">LEARNFAST.TXT</a>. Each
         LearnFast session is meant to have two 15-minute parts - training and
         testing. Only the training part is currently implemented.

         I once suggested creating an immersive adventure game called
         <a
            href="https://mw.lojban.org/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&profile=all&search=lojbo+munje&fulltext=Search">lojbo
            munje</a>, but I no longer plan to actually build it.
